## 🛠️ Data Cleaning Steps Performed

Before building the dashboard, the raw data was cleaned using the following steps:

1. ✅ **Removed Duplicates** – Ensured unique rows for clean analysis.
2. ✅ **Filled Missing Values**:
   - Missing **Order Date** entries were filled with appropriate dates.
   - Missing **Quantity** entries were filled using logical assumptions or averages.
3. ✅ **Standardized Country Names** – Fixed inconsistent formatting and spelling (e.g., `usa` → `USA`).
4. ✅ **Validated Order IDs** – Ensured all order IDs were meaningful and not corrupted.
5. ✅ **Date Formatting** – Converted date fields to a consistent `DD-MM-YYYY` format for uniformity in charts and pivot tables.
